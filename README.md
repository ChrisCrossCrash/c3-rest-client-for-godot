# C3 OpenAI-Compatible Client for Godot

A drop-in Godot 4 client node for OpenAI-compatible HTTP APIs. Works with [OpenAI](https://openai.com/api/), [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/), [speaches](https://speaches.ai/), and any other server that speaks the OpenAI REST API. This is a runtime addon for adding AI features to your game, **not** an editor assistant or Copilot-style tool.

## Features

- Chat completions — non-streaming or streaming (token-by-token via signals)
- Vision (image input) support
- `"type": "json_schema"` [structured output](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/structured-outputs) support
- Text-to-speech (returns a ready-to-play `AudioStream`)
- Speech-to-text / transcription (`AudioStreamMP3` and `AudioStreamWAV`)
- List available models
- Every method returns a typed response object — check `.ok` to detect failure

## Compatibility

Tested on Godot 4.6.x with automated ([GUT](https://github.com/bitwes/Gut)) and manual tests. Manually verified to work back to Godot 4.0.0.

## Installation

To install `C3OpenAIClient` in your Godot project, simply click on the "Asset Store" tab on the top of the Godot editor window and search for "C3 OpenAI-Compatible Client". Then, click "Download" and "Install". The addon will be automatically added to your project, and the `C3OpenAIClient` node will be available in the "Create New Node" dialog.

Alternatively, you may download the latest release from [GitHub](https://github.com/ChrisCrossCrash/c3-openai-client-for-godot/releases) and copy the contents of the `addons/c3_openai_client` folder into your project's `addons/c3_openai_client` directory.

## Quick start

1. In your scene, choose **Add Child Node** and search for `C3OpenAIClient`.
2. Set **Base URL** in the Inspector (e.g. `https://api.openai.com/v1`).
3. Reference it from your scene script:

    ```gdscript
    @onready var client: C3OpenAIClient = $C3OpenAIClient

    func _ready() -> void:
        # Get the API key from an environment variable and set it on the client.
    	# You can skip this step for servers that don't require authentication.
    	client.api_key = OS.get_environment("OPENAI_API_KEY")

    	var messages := [
    		C3OpenAIClient.make_system_msg("You are a poor villager."),
    		C3OpenAIClient.make_user_msg("En garde!"),
    	]
    	var opts := C3OpenAIClient.ChatOptions.new()
    	opts.model = "gpt-5.4-mini"

    	var res := await client.chat_completion(messages, opts)
    	if res.ok:
    		print(res.content)  # *Gasps sharply, dropping my basket of half-rotten turnips...
    	else:
    		push_error("Chat failed: " + str(res.error))
    ```
